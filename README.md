### Section 1: Camera Calibration

### Section 1: Homography & Tracking

We use SIFT & ORB as feature detectors to get matching descriptors between a given image that we're matching with another 
image or with the live webcam.

Usage: 

```python
    detector = Detector("<query-image-path>") # images/detect.jpg as an example
```

`detector.track_on_webcam()` is used to access the webcam, it matches the descriptors and finds the homography matrix `H`, 
and applies it with a bounding box. Here's an example:

`detector.detect("<target-image-path>") # e.g. - images/detect_book.jpg` uses the target image to match with the query image
with which the detector was initialized. After finding matching descriptors, it draws lines between them. Here's an example:

### Section 2: Single Value Decomposition

We will try a Single Value Decomposition on an image with variable
ranks to see how much information is being stored at each rank for image compression.

As we know, ```X = UÎ£V^T```, and we want to figure out the SVD for the image i.e. X is the grayscale image
