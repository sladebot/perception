#### Section: Single Value Decomposition

We will try a Single Value Decomposition on an image with variable
ranks to see how much information is being stored at each rank for image compression.

As we know, ```X = UÎ£V^T```, and we want to figure out the SVD for the image i.e. X is the grayscale image
